# Grant Duntugan

## Who am I?

I am a programmer who goes to the University of California, San Diego. I am currently in my 3rd year, and I plan to graduate in 2023.

## What are my interests?

I plan on becoming a software engineer in the future. I _love_ to create things, especially if other people can find use in them. Other than coding, some of my favorite hobbies are below:

- Chess
- TV
- Music (Kpop!)
- Ice skating
- Walking to places

## Practical Experience

I tutor/teach grade-school children in Computer Science! I have taught mainly Python and Java. We go over the fundamentals: printing, variables, loops, functions, lists, etc. After that, we can even get to USACO training and questions. All of my exposure to these languages really strengthens my foundations in coding. I have experience with app development in **React Native and Firebase**, and I have also used **C, C++, Java, and Python** in multiple console based projects. Or in other words,

```
printf("Hello World!\n");

std::cout << "Hello World!\n";

System.out.println("Hello World!");

print("Hello World")
```

Here are some of the projects I have created:

# 1. Espresso (_React Native, Firebase_)

A productivity app designed to use competitivity in order to boost your motivation! Gain points through productive activities in order to rank higher than your friends and gain arbitrary rewards. Most of the app is user-decided, allowing a lot of flexibility when creating groups, designing tasks, and of course, redeeming rewards.

# 2. Huffman Coding Tree (_C++_)

A console based software that takes in a text file as input and compresses and outputs a file with the coded content using a Huffman Coding Tree.

> Because this was a school project, I cannot link the repository here due to academic integrity violations. However, as instructed, I am able to release this upon request. My email: gduntuga@ucsd.edu

## Anything else?

I've been trying to solve a lot of Leetcode questions on my own time. Here are some questions I have either solved, not solved, or thought about solving.

- [x] [Two Sum](./twosum.md)
- [ ] Add Two Numbers
- [x] Nth Tribonacci Number
